# Braking-System
Contributed to the end-to-end development of a Formula Student race car, fully built from scratch in the Team V_locity workshop through extensive design–manufacture–test cycles 


Led the Brakes Department, overseeing system design, component selection, force and thermal calculations, and performance modeling for optimal stopping efficiency under rulebook constraints 


Designed a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system with front–rear biasing, conducted deceleration modeling, brake force distribution analysis, and clamping pressure validation to meet safety-critical standards 


Supervised the manufacture of drilled rotors and caliper assemblies, ensuring reliable water and debris dispersion while maintaining thermal integrity under repeated stress cycles 


Coordinated cross-departmental design integration, working closely with Suspension, Steering, and Ergonomics teams to align brake packaging with upright geometry and ensure seamless mechanical interfacing 


Implemented component-level FEA (Ansys) to verify pedal deflection, disc thermal loads, and mounting stress paths under extreme race conditions 


Managed training programs for junior team members and recruited new talent, organizing multiple hands-on sessions on braking fundamentals, system design, and testing workflows 


Oversaw rigorous testing protocols for every subsystem of the car, ensuring full compliance with Formula Bharat regulations and continuous design iteration based on test data 


Collaborated on chassis–brake–suspension triangulation, optimizing weight distribution and minimizing CG height while balancing driver accessibility and safety envelope 


Participated in core manufacturing processes including arc welding of the AISI 1018 steel chassis, machining of wishbones and knuckles, and hydraulic line routing, gaining firsthand experience in applied fabrication
